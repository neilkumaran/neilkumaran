# Hi, I'm Neil Kumaran

[![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=neilkumaran&theme=github_dark)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I'm a 16-year-old developer who likes building practical tools, experimenting with systems, and getting older hardware to do things they were never intended to do. I focus on writing useful software and understanding how machines behave under the hood, whether that involves low-level programming, troubleshooting unusual problems, or modernizing older devices.

Beware you may find a lot of school assignments on my GitHub, like websites I've hosted for projects, etc. They should be specifically mentioned.

## What I Work On

### Systems and Software

* Utilities and tools written in C and C++
* Backend development in Python and JavaScript
* Projects designed to work well across different environments

### Hardware and Modding

* Restoring and upgrading older machines
* Running modern operating systems on unsupported hardware
* System configuration, tuning, and experimentation

### Operating Systems and Environments

* Custom development setups
* Virtualization and system performance work
* Understanding the interaction between software and hardware

## My Current Hardware

### ThinkPad P14s Gen 3 AMD (Main Dev Machine)

Runs Arch Linux and serves as my primary setup for development and school work.

### Desktop PC

Ryzen 5 3600X with an RTX 3070 Ti.
Used for heavier workloads, GPU tasks, and gaming.

### My "Macs"

#### ThinkCentre M900

i5-6600 with Intel HD 530 running macOS Sequoia via OpenCore.
Used for macOS-specific development and testing.

#### 2010 iMac

Upgraded with a faster SSD and running macOS Sequoia through OpenCore.
Despite its age, it's still fully capable and was the machine I used to develop **Venatio** from start to finish:

Pushing hardware like this and keeping it useful is something I really enjoy.
